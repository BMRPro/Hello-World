Tutorial Repository 
I'm new to coding/programming all I've donw with Computers is build a couple thats it.
I'm very athletic form Soccer to Cross-Country after that in the warmer seanson I did Track & Feild as well as Lifting weight in that whole time.
I've all ways like Science/Computers but never new enough to do anything with it.
now that I've recently lost my job which was good money but I really didn't like such negative/miserable management that runs the company.
This coding/programming looks tough to learn as i'm not the brithest bulb in the pack but I would like to learn.
For I know how to work hard so I would like to learn all i can to start a career in somthing that well make great income a not go out of style or deamand anytime soon.
